# Ada Off-by-One Error
This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Ada programming when accessing array elements.  The example code incorrectly attempts to access an array element outside its bounds, leading to a runtime error.
The solution provides the correct approach to iterate through an array and access its elements using Ada's built-in range attributes.
